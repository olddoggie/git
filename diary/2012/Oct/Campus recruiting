Today is Oct 15th, we went to Shanghai University to kick off our 2013 Campus Recruiting programme.
I was with Charlie who is the HR VP and delievered a 10-min speech to the College students,who would be graduated in summer 2013.
It was a really nice experience to share my little story and feeling wiht 'em, back to campus made me pretty relax and excited.
One and a half year after i left the holy place, now i was back, taken a bow as a "hero" and encouraged the young students,whose eyes told me, they really admired me so much,that's amazing.. Not too long before, i was one of them, don't know what i should do,don't know where is my future.
Thanks God, in many ways, Bleum is not as good as i expected, but im gonna be grateful to this company all of my life, this is the place where im taking off.
Be modest,im goona fly high, just do it! Come on...
