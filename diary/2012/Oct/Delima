Oct 26th. Always fall meyself into a delima..
Scenario often like this,i pay for a 6-yuan stuff and give out 10 yuan but only get back 3 yuan.. The moment i can clearly feel that the guy is taking advantage of me for the additional 1 yuan.
I will feel like Ooo,what a mean guy.. But i almost never point this out. 'Cause by native, i don't have the talent on such things, it makes me feel awkard and embarrassed to speak out and
i was too lazy to argue something just for myself,and sometimes just fell into a delima,lose faith to be aggressive and once i miss the moment, i'd rather leave without saying anything,dumb assam i.. such a coward and weakling!
I hate the feeling, it cannot makes me even be too bad about myself, sometimes it's just because of the personality thing,which is hard to change at all..So depressing...
Finally i made up my mind to be tough to be mature to be more like a real man, i know it's hard to do it like all through one night, and i still proud of the advantages of my personality,i meani'm kind, i'm sensitive, i'm warm-hearted, but i have to be more like a man, doing what a real man should do! Why always consider too much, why delima always traps my mind, just do it if you
really want, just be strong and confident and mature, go for it! I'm gonna train myself to enhance my capbility on such stuffs, it should be struggling at first, but struggling is the natural
way to grow up, i have to be a man, im 24 year soon, i must change , even little by little , even slow and tiny, i have to do this, you know, this is not for myself only, also for the people 
who care about me, for the strangers who maybe hurt by the same guy if i don't expose the stuff and give the mean guy a lesson  when it happens to me, for the sake of God's love.
I have to be the best man I can be, and I have to be one of the best men in my family and friends' eyes, I promise sincerely.
