Oct 23. I don't know what to say here, 'cause i totally ruined the whole stuff...
But u know, at least, i made a decision to change myself, slightly but firmly.From now on ,i would push myself to be a real man, not a boy anymore.
Since i already updated the whole stuff on my blog, so i will just let it gone in this diary.
Today,actually I have another interesting finding is the acadmic manager of our company, Daisy, whose daughter alwasys dressed up in purple plaid shirt,very cute... The interesting
thing is whenever i have the chance to meet her, say something or just make a greeting, every time, everytime we do this, i must be wearing my purple plaid shirt myself ...
Yep, I like the romantic color, i like plaid shirt which shapes up my body and makes me look like fit and refreshing. We call this Purple Plaid Kong. ^_^
