Oct 16th, tonight read a nice passage about recalling Steve Job,the ex chairman of Apple.
In the article,the author says,"Any person that touched an Apple device knows it breathes the dedication and craftmanship that has been put into them,and it is an awesome feeling.Our kids will take this for granted,but we are still aware of where we came from."
Not only reshaping the world,but also a guy who had huge impacts on developers,"Steve has been able to make developers around the world more aware of their impact to users.That you should push hard to leave out unnecessary details.That is important to pay attention to detail.That build software might be hard,but using software shouldn't!"
Impressive and motivating words hovering around my head,i was again firmly and deeply believed in that,thousands of genius all of the world, past and future,but Steve is unique!Steve has gone,but the products he left and the invisible fortune,the mental stuffs he left on us will last forever,just like his words,"Stay hungry,Stay foolish."
