I found myself in a deep crush on my good friend, Miss Fay...
Maybe she just treats me as a normal friend, but im never feeling so great, love is love, i have to be true to myself.
I believe she is gonna talking this with me,im waitiing for the chance.
Oh god, please help me on this again, im a shy guy, not good at relationship thing...T
he reason why im so obcessed is that i really really like her,i trust her, i appreciate her beautiful beautiful personality,which is like a brilliant star,shining in the dark sky...
We are similar in many ways,but i just don't know her real feeeling lying in her heart,anyway,when there's a chance,i'm gonna have a try.
